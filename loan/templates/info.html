      <h2>Loan Prediction</h2>
      <p>Loan prediction is an essential tool for financial institutions that want to minimize their risks when offering loans to their clients. By predicting the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan, lenders can make informed decisions on whether to approve or reject a loan application, and also determine the appropriate loan amount and interest rate.</p>
      <p>To use a loan prediction model, you will need to provide certain information about the borrower, such as their credit history, income, employment status, and loan amount. The model will then use this data to make a prediction on the likelihood of the borrower defaulting on the loan.</p>
      <p>If you are a lender, you can use the loan prediction model to determine the level of risk associated with each loan application, and make a decision on whether to approve or reject the loan. This can help you minimize the risk of default, and ensure that you are offering loans to clients who are most likely to repay them.</p>
      <p>If you are a borrower, you can use a loan prediction model to get an idea of the likelihood of your loan application being approved. By providing accurate information about your credit history, income, and employment status, you can increase your chances of getting approved for a loan, and also ensure that you are getting the best possible interest rate.</p>
